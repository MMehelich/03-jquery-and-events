## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
A user would want to be able to filter articles so that they can selectively view them by author or by category. A user would aslo want to be able to preview each article so that they can easily view the results and select the one they want to read further as well as collapse an expanded article to the teaser view so that they can more easily scan over a series of articles.  There is now also tab-based navigation so that a user can easily visit other sections of the site. For developers, the code is thoughtfully organized, easy to read, and executing efficiently.
